# Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul Addon

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate various NPC overhauls into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. From creators such as LalupK, Tragedian, Southpawe, Mharlek1, Kalilies, Pandorable, and Rxkx22, these overhauls aim to flesh out the personality of each NPC through facelifts and enhancements. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, compacting, ESLifiying, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide. 

**It's essential to pay attention to load order for this branch! Otherwise, you'll run into mismatched faces and inconsistent AI behaviors!**

A **NEW SAVE is recommended**, just to ensure the weight changes from the various overhauls are automatically applied. If you do the process on an **EXISTING SAVE** it's not the end of the world, but you may run into slight gaps between the head and the body on a select few of NPCs. This can be fixed by opening the console via **'** then clicking the NPC in question, and lastly typing **"setnpcweight 35"** (or any number between 0 and 100). Then type **"disable"** and immediately after **"enable"**.

### A mini 50 picture album previewing some of the NPCs covered can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/L4OkkHj).
   - **Please note** the I had three off-guide mods installed at the time of taking these pictures; HIMBO Outfit Refits, TMB Outfit Refits, and my own custom skin textures. Other than those, everything else is completely straight up from Septimus!

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - NPC OVERHAULS**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **below all of the Septimus patches**.

### Phew! If you've made it this far, then congrats! We're almost there!

We should have our setup looking similar to this (you may be using a different MO2 theme than me, but that's okay it'll all work the same!):

![Image 1](https://i.imgur.com/qa5Q6DT.png)

Now we're going to compact these overhauls so there's enough space to use them with Septimus. Don't worry, it's really easy! 

# Compacting

We're going to go to where you normally launch Septimus, and you're going to click **<Edit...>**. In the pop-up window we're going to do a few things.

![Image 2](https://i.imgur.com/Mlo1SrL.png)

  - On the left, select SSEEdit. 
  - Toward the bottom, UNTICK the "Hide in user interface" box. 
  - Then hit Apply and OK.

![Image 3](https://i.imgur.com/vwtRWff.png)

Now we'll be able to use SSEEdit (also known as xEdit) from the drop-down menu! So go ahead and click run. 

![Image 4](https://i.imgur.com/vjdwEVP.png)

Right-click anywhere on the page and pick "Select None". Scroll down to the very bottom and **ONLY** select the NPC overhauls we're working with. 

![Image 5](https://i.imgur.com/vFC1RhS.png)
![Image 5A](https://i.imgur.com/C6rfYZP.png)

Once it's finished opening, click OK to get rid of the ModGroups message. So first, right-click on the plugin **Northbourne NPCs of Whiterun Hold**. Scroll down to the Compact FormIDs for ESL option and select it. 

![Image 6](https://i.imgur.com/Gb3rsUp.png)

A warning will appear asking if you're sure, just click Yes.

![Image 7](https://i.imgur.com/r023k3o.png)

Left-click the plugin on the left again, then look to the right side where you'll see an empty box next to **Record Flags**. Right-click it, and select Edit from the pop-up.

![Image 8](https://i.imgur.com/b88aL0Q.png)

Tick **ONLY** the ESL option, and click OK. 

![Image 9](https://i.imgur.com/sxEGUfV.png)

Then vola you are almost DONE! Do the same steps for all of the NPC overhauls you selected. There are some mods you can skip, such as Dapper Deliveries and PAN_Initiates for example, as they are already flagged as ESL files.

  - **IMPORTANT** - Be sure to **SAVE YOUR WORK**, and exit and program once you're done!

# Last Steps

### Snag the megapatch from here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Overhauls%20Megapatch%20v1.3.1.7z) ] ("View raw" button)

Name it **[NoDelete] Septimus Extended - NPC Overhauls Megapatch**, and place it directly AFTER [NoDelete] [23] Lalup's NPCs - Creation Club - Salt and Wind. It's important that the following overhauls are at the very bottom on both the left and right side of MO2.

### Then you are SET! Thanks for sticking with it the entire process, enjoy your game!

   - **Currently works with version 4.2.1 of Septimus.**
   - **A patch for [Septimus-Extended---LOTD Addon (OPEN BETA)](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---LOTD/blob/master/README.md) can be found here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Overhauls%20Megapatch%20-%20LOTD%20Patch.7z) ] ("View raw" button).**
   - **A patch for [Septimus-Extended - NPC Dialogue Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Dialogue/blob/main/README.md) can be found here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Overhauls%20Megapatch%20-%20NPC%20Dialogue%20Patch.7z) ] ("View raw" button). All the mods in that addon need to load BEFORE this one on BOTH sides of MO2.**

**Load order for the patches is like so;**
   - Septimus
   - Danger Zone
   - NPC Dialogue Addon (if installed)
   - NPC Dialogue Addon Megapatch (if installed)
   - LOTD Addon (if installed)
   - LOTD Addon Megapatch (if installed)
   - NPC Overhaul
   - NPC Overhaul Megapatch
   - NPC Overhaul Megapatch - NPC Dialogue Addon Patch (if installed)
   - NPC Overhaul Megapatch - LOTD Addon Patch (if installed)

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Septimus (like from v.4.2.0 to 4.2.1 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire NPC Overhaul addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).

v.1.4.0
   - Updated megapatch

v.1.3.0
   - Updated megapatch to work with 4.2.1 of Septimus. 
   - **IMPORTANT** - If updating, you have no extra steps! Just download the updated megapatch and you are set. <3

v.1.2.0
   - Fixed Serana and Valerica's purple eyes. 
   - **IMPORTANT** - If updating you'll need to reinstall Bijin Fixes (AIO or Separate) and ONLY tick the "With USSEP" option, then nothing else on the next 2 pages. Then you'll need to unhide the .esps from the Seranaholic and Valerica mods, then compact them as you did with the other overhauls. Install the new megapatch and you'll be good to go.
   - Updated megapatch
