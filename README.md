# Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul Addon

![Image 0](https://i.imgur.com/23RCf3a.png)

# Introduction

Hello! This addon will integrate various NPC overhauls into the world of Septimus-ified Skyrim. From creators such as Tragedian, Southpawe, Pandorable, Rxkx22, and more, these overhauls aim to flesh out the personality of each NPC through facelifts and enhancements. This will be a **manual process** with various steps involving downloading, compacting, ESLifiying, rearranging, etc. A provided megapatch will be available at the end of the guide. 

**It's essential to pay attention to load order for this branch! Otherwise, you'll run into mismatched faces and inconsistent AI behaviors!**

A **NEW SAVE is recommended**, just to ensure the weight changes from the various overhauls are automatically applied. If you do the process on an **EXISTING SAVE** it's not the end of the world, but you may run into slight gaps between the head and the body on a select few of NPCs. This can be fixed by opening the console via **'** then clicking the NPC in question, and lastly typing **"setnpcweight 35"** (or any number between 0 and 100). Then type **"disable"** and immediately after **"enable"**.

### A mini 50 picture album previewing some of the NPCs covered can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/L4OkkHj).
   - **Please note** the I had four off-guide mods installed at the time of taking these pictures; HIMBO Outfit Refits, TMB Outfit Refits, Sforzinda's Recolours, and my own custom skin textures. Other than those, everything else is completely straight up from Septimus!

# Installation

First of all, we're going to right-click on the left side of MO2 and highlight the "All Mods" option, then click the dropdown of "Create separator above". We'll call it **[NoDelete] SEPTIMUS EXTENDED - NPC OVERHAULS**. All of the following mods will be installed under this separator, and the separator itself will go just below the separator called "THE DANGER ZONE". 

All the plugins going forward will be at the very bottom, **BELOW all of the Septimus patches** and **BELOW the Occlusion.esp**.

# Last Steps

**My theme of MO2 may be different than yours, but that's okay it'll all work the same!**
   - Here's how it should look on the **left side of MO2**:

![Image 2](https://i.imgur.com/jNpV6Vq.png)

   - Then here's how it should look on the **right side of MO2**:

![Image 3](https://i.imgur.com/mCK7TuD.png)

### Snag the megapatch from here: [ [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Overhaul/blob/main/Septimus%20Extended%20-%20NPC%20Overhaul%20Megapatch.7z) ] ("View raw" button)

Name it **[NoDelete] Septimus Extended - NPC Overhauls Megapatch**, and place it directly AFTER [NoDelete] [26] Legacy of the Dragonborn Visual Overhaul. It's important that the following overhauls are at the very bottom on both the left and right side of MO2.

### Then you are SET! Thanks for sticking with it the entire process, enjoy your game!

   - **Currently in the process of testing with version 1.0.3+ of Septimus.**
   - **Currently works with [Septimus-Extended - NPC Dialogue Addon](https://github.com/Foamimi/Septimus-Extended---NPC-Dialogue/blob/main/README.md).**

# Changelog

**IMPORTANT** - If updating Septimus (like from v.1.0.1 to 1.0.2 for example) your load order may become a bit funky on the right side of MO2. Luckily we numbered everything while installing, so the left side of MO2 should still be in tact, but to get everything back in position for the right side, I'd suggest disabling the entire NPC Overhaul addon, then re-enabling everything again one by one. This takes a hot second, but I find this method to be the fastest (for me anyway!).

2.0
   - Rebuilt from the ground up.
